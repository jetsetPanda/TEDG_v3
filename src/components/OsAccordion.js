                <li> Do not eat anything or drink hot fluids until the numbness has worn off to avoid injury from accidental biting or burning.  </li>
                <li> No vigorous rinsing, drinking through a straw, or spitting for 3 days so the blood clot will not be disturbed. </li>
                <li> Today, rest as much as possible with your head elevated. No vigorous exercising for 3 days.  </li>
                <li> Slight bleeding is normal for several hours following surgery. If persistent bleeding occurs,place a wet tea bag on the involved area and apply direct pressure for 15-20 continuous
    minutes. Repeat as necessary.  </li>
                <li> Do not pull back the lips or cheeks to look at the area as this can disturb the surgical site and
    increase complications.  </li>
                <li> Do not eat by the surgical area for 1 week. Soft nutritious foods will be necessary for the first
    few days. Avoid acidic, spicy, hot (in temperature), and crunchy foods. Drink plenty of fluids.  </li>
<li> Do not use tobacco or drink alcohol as these will delay healing.  </li>
<li> Swelling can be lessened by placing a cold compress on the face and alternating on and off
    for 20 minutes during the first 72 hours.  </li>
<li> Take all medications the doctor has prescribed for you according to directions.  </li>
<li> Starting 24 hours after surgery, gently rinse your mouth with Â¼ teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces
      of warm water 3 times a day.  </li>
<li> After periodontal treatment, proper oral hygiene must be maintained in the surgical area to
     aid in healing. After 1 week, carefully brush the teeth while avoiding the gums in the area of
     surgery. The gums and lower parts of the teeth should be cleaned with a dampened piece of
     cotton. Gentle flossing can be resumed in 2-3 weeks. Regular brushing can be resumed after
     3 weeks.  </li>
<li> After periodontal surgery, sensitivity of the teeth may occur. This is remedied by maintaining
      proper oral hygiene and by the use of specially formulated sensitive toothpaste, such as
      Sensodyne. </li>
<li> If a periodontal pack has been placed in your mouth, do not remove it. The pack should
      remain in place for 1 week. If the pack comes off before this time, it is not an emergency, but
      the doctor should be notified.  </li>
<li> Return for your appointment to have the periodontal pack and any sutures removed. If the
      sutures loosen or come out within 3 days, please inform the office.  </li>
<li> If you have questions or concerns, please call our office at <a href="tel:212-422-9229">(212) 422-9229</a>. </li>
